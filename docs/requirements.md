# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### 1. RMS Integration Service - Price Adjustment Schedule (PAS) Processing
- Deploy multiple RMS Integration Service instances, each handling specific store groups
- Execute daily data retrieval via REST service per instance
- Transform JSON/CSV data to pipe-delimited format.
- Map schedule data to **PriceLogix Schedule Entry (PSE)** format specifications.
- Support up to six adjustment dates per event.
- Process and map inventory impact dates.
- Maintain fiscal period alignment.
- Handle event type classification and mapping.
- Publish processed data to RabbitMQ for downstream processing
- Implement OAuth 2.0 client credentials authentication for RMS API access
- Manage and securely store OAuth client credentials
- Handle token acquisition and renewal
- Support configuration of OAuth endpoints for different environments

### 2. PriceLogix Feed Service - Price Adjustment Processing (PAD/PRA)
- Monitor local directories for incoming price adjustment files.
- Validate file format and header information.
- Transform data into **PriceLogix Adjustment Record (PAR)** format according to business rules.
- Process store location hierarchy data monthly.
- Support location expansion for PRA records.
- Map status codes based on record type and action:
  - PAD: ADD → PRICE_ADJ, DEL → PRICE_ADJ_CANCEL
  - PRA: ADD → PRICE_RESTORE, DEL → PRICE_RESTORE_CANCEL.

### 3. Message Queue Integration
- Configure RabbitMQ for multi-publisher, single-consumer architecture
- Support multiple RMS Integration Service instances publishing to shared exchange
- Maintain message persistence.
- Implement sequential message processing by PriceLogix Feed Service
- Handle message routing and delivery with RabbitMQ.
- Implement retry policies with exponential backoff.
- Process Dead Letter Queue messages every 15 minutes.

### 4. File Management
- Archive processed files automatically.
- Clean up archive files after one week.
- Move failed files to an error directory.
- Maintain input-output file traceability.
- Generate standardized output file names.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- Support concurrent processing across multiple RMS Integration Service instances
- Maintain 500ms maximum message processing time per record
- Handle queue depth up to 1000 messages across all publishing instances
- Implement 3-retry policy with exponential backoff for failed processing
- Support staggered scheduling to prevent system resource contention
- Monitor individual instance performance and overall system throughput

### 2. Reliability
- Ensure message delivery guarantees.
- Maintain data consistency during processing.
- Support transaction logging and rollback.

### 3. Security
- Implement TLS encryption for RabbitMQ.
- Support certificate management:
  - Self-signed certificates for development.
  - Let’s Encrypt for production.
- Use RabbitMQ's built-in authentication with username/password credentials.
- Maintain secure file handling.
- Log security events, including failed authentications and unauthorized access.

### 4. Monitoring and Observability
- Integrate with Prometheus for metrics collection across all service instances
- Provide Grafana dashboards showing both instance and aggregate performance
- Implement comprehensive logging:
  - JSON-formatted log entries.
  - Multiple logging levels (Informational, Warning, Error).
  - Contextual error information.
- Monitor queue health and performance.
- Track processing metrics and latency.

### 5. Maintainability
- Follow coding standards and best practices.
- Provide comprehensive documentation.
- Implement modular design.
- Support easy configuration changes.
- Enable straightforward deployment processes.

### 6. Compliance
- Maintain audit trails.
- Support data retention policies.
- Enable transaction tracing.
- Provide security event logging.

## Technical Constraints

- RabbitMQ message broker with TLS encryption.
- Prometheus monitoring and Grafana visualization.
- Docker for containerization.
- Gradle build system with multi-module support.
- Support for PSE and PAR format validation and transformation
- Implementation of format-specific error handling and logging
- Performance optimization for both PSE and PAR processing paths

## Integration Points
- RMS REST service for PAS data.
- RMS file system for PAD/PRA data.
- PriceLogix Enterprise Optimizer.
- Monitoring and logging systems.
- Administrative interfaces.
